## Usage

Once the app is running, access it on your device using Expo. The app enables swiping left (reject), swiping up (super like), and swiping right (like) on different cards representing individuals. If there is a high match percentage, you'll be navigated to the "MatchScreen" to view details of the matched individual.

## Components

### Card Component

The Card component renders swipable cards using the `react-tinder-card` library. It displays information about the individual, including their name, age, location, and an image. Buttons for rejecting, super liking, and liking the individual are also present.

### App Component

The App component serves as the entry point and includes the navigation setup, rendering the `AppNavigator` component.



## Screens

### HomeScreen

The HomeScreen is the primary screen, rendering the Card component for users to swipe through cards.
