Usage
Once the app is running, you can access it on your device using Expo. The app allows you to swipe left (reject), swipe up (super like), and swipe right (like) different cards representing individuals. If there is a match with a high match percentage, you will be navigated to the "MatchScreen" to view the details of the matched individual.

Components
Card Component
The Card component is responsible for rendering the swipable cards. It uses the react-tinder-card library to handle the swiping functionality. The card displays information about the individual, including their name, age, location, and an image. It also has buttons for rejecting, super liking, and liking the individual.

##  Component
The App component is the entry point of the application. It includes the navigation setup and renders the AppNavigator component.

## Screens
### HomeScreen
The HomeScreen is the main screen of the app. It renders the Card component, allowing users to swipe through the cards.

### MatchScreen 
 MatchScreen is displayed when there is a match with a high match percentage. It shows detailed information about the matched individual.

### Styling 
The styles for the components are defined in the styles object within the respective component files. Styling is done using a combination of Flexbox and custom styles.

##  Future Steps
Here are some future steps you can consider for enhancing the PoshPair app:

##  User Authentication: Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and log in.

## Backend Integration: Connect the app to a backend server to store and retrieve user data and card information.

##   User Profiles: Create user profiles with   information and settings.

##Chat  Features: Implement a chat feature for users who have matched with each other.

##Animations: Add animations to enhance the user experience during card swiping and transitions.

##Testing: Conduct thorough testing on various devices to ensure a seamless user experience.
